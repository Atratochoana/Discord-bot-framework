This is a discord bot framework based off of [UnderCtrl's Discord.js v14 tutorial series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZ3tIGHU314&list=PLpmb-7WxPhe0ZVpH9pxT5MtC4heqej8Es)

# How to add stuff
## Adding slash commands
Adding slash commands is pretty straight forward, go to the ***src\commands*** folder and create a new js file naming it however you want, inside of it use the ping.js as an example and copy that
>[!note]
>The attributes deleted is used to remove a command from the slash command window on discord otherwise it will stay there even if you delete the file
>The attribute userPermissions and permissionLevel are used to assign permission levels and requirements for users to use [WIP]
